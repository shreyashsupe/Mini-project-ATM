Here I have created a mini project of ATM using C++.
So this mini project is going to consist of ATM functionalities implimented using OOP's concept.
The functionalities are: 1) Check balance: The user can check the balance of his/her account balnce. 2) Cash WithDraw: User can Withdraw cash from an ATM. But the only condition is
user must enter the valid input, like the amount to be withdraw should be less than account balance. 3) User Details: User can see and cross check his/her details in bank.
4) Update Mobile no. :The user can update his/her mobile number.
